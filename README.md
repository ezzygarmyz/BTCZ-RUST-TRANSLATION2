BitcoinZ Rust Translation
This repository contains the Rust-based implementation of the BitcoinZ blockchain, aiming to modernize and optimize the original BitcoinZ Core for performance, security, and maintainability.

Overview
BitcoinZ is a decentralized cryptocurrency focusing on community-driven development, privacy, and scalability. This project is a full Rust translation of the original BitcoinZ Core, preserving the blockchain’s principles while leveraging Rust's performance and safety features.

Key Features
Full Node Implementation:

Supports wallet management, transaction validation, block creation, and networking.
Rust Optimization:

Improved performance and memory safety with Rust's modern language features.
Consensus Mechanism:

Preserves BitcoinZ’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism for mining and network security.
Smart Contract Readiness:

Lays the groundwork for future Layer 2 integration, enabling smart contract capabilities.
Improved Networking:

Efficient peer-to-peer (P2P) networking implemented in Rust for better scalability.
Directory Structure
Core Components
