Code Style Guidelines
To maintain consistency, follow these style guidelines:

Formatting:

Use rustfmt to format your code:
cargo fmt
Linting:

Run clippy to catch common mistakes:
cargo clippy
Documentation:

Document public functions and modules using Rust's doc comments (///).
Naming Conventions:

Use snake_case for variables and function names.
Use PascalCase for structs and enums.
Testing and Validation
1. Unit Tests
Write unit tests for all new features or fixes. Place them in the same file as the code being tested:

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_example() {
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }
}
2. Integration Tests
Add integration tests in the tests directory for end-to-end functionality:

cargo test --test integration_test_name
3. Continuous Integration
Ensure your changes pass CI checks:

GitHub Actions will automatically run tests and verify formatting/linting on pull requests.
